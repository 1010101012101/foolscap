* ripping out stream-side constraint checking:
 stop calling checkToken, openerCheckToken
  need to add checking in receiveChild, e.g. NoneUnslicer must reject
 in Unslicers:
  stop raising Violation from doOpen, start, receiveChild, receiveClose, finish
 remove maxSize/maxDepth

tests take 93s, or 54s without test_logging

* hrm, big project. How to break it into pieces?
** DONE remove maxSize/maxDepth
** stop testing banana constraints. Make sure that callRemote constraints are
   still being tested
** stop testing things that send ABORT
   - test_banana.DecodeTest.test_aborted_list*
** TODO stop calling checkToken, openerCheckToken. Add replacement checks
   where necessary.
** Remove both
** remove "raise Violation" from unslicers
** remove "except Violation" handlers from banana.py
** remove discardCount, reject from banana.py

* ok, defer that project. fix O(n^2) without it. Retain discard.
