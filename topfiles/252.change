Foolscap tools no longer accept "tcp:0" as a listening port, nor do they
automatically detect the host's IP addresses in an attempt to build
externally-reachable FURLs. In particular:

* 'flappserver create' now requires --location
 * if '--port' is provided, it must not be tcp:0
 * '--port' defaults to tcp:3116
